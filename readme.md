### eGene 
eGene is a gene that has at least one genetic variant associated with its expression (measured by amount of RNA produced). There is also Pgene which is the analogous, where the gene expression is measured by the amount of protein produced. 

### Find eGenes

This code finds eGenes. There are two ways to compute the eGene p-values (1) permutation test and (2) sampling the null denstity from Mvn distribution. 

It is a bit too involved to explain the detail here. Please refer to the parent website at UCLA Genetics Department. http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/egene-mvn/index.html 

The instruction.txt explains how to run this code.
