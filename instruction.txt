Run the executable as follows

./computeOneGenePval_permutation 
            --var [covariates age, gender etc] this is a .txt input
            --numCov [# components such as age, gender etc] 
            --expr [gene expression] also .txt input 
            --geno [variants] also .txt input
            --numSNP [# variants] 
            --w [prior] also .txt input. priors will be normalized inside the code. 
            --final [permutation test p-value output] 
            --pval [minimum p-value among all variants output] 
            --lrt [maximum likelihood ratio output] 
            --permutation [# permutations] should be at least 1000
            --seed [random seed] 
            --alt [alternative mean] this is a number. this option is ignored when --reuse is set to 1.  
            --reuse [reuse estimated mean as alternative mean] this is 1/0 for yes/no
